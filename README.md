Description:

This is a simple Full Stack Star Wars application specific to star ships.
This will seed the data retrieved for Star Wars Star Ships from the SWAPI api (https://swapi.dev/api/starships/)
Then a basic CRUD api for accessing that newly created database which also includes Swagger access for the api.
Also a basic SPA for accessing the CRUD functionality.

How to Run Locally:

  Install:
  1. Visual Studio with .Net 8
  2. SQL Server Express LocalDB- this can be included in the Visual Studio install by choosing Data Storage and Processing but if you don't have that included the following link is where you can install
      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver16
  3. NPM Install within the directory of the starwarswebsite.client of the downloaded project.
  
Run:
  1. Open the solution with Visual Studio and click start. This will fire off the data seeding if it's the first time and then pull up the API and UI.
